# Project-CIPHER
CIPHER is an AI research project evaluating how subliminal hidden signals, like zero width Unicode characters or positional encodings, can transfer bias from teacher models to student models during knowledge distillation. The project measures behavioral &amp; representational shifts to better understand hidden pathway risks in safe model development.
